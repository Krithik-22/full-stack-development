How to test a server endpoint with VS Code's REST Client
Goal: To test a server endpoint without a browser. The server's res.end() output is sent over the network, not to the terminal.
Tool: REST Client extension for VS Code.
Setup
Install: REST Client extension by Huachao Mao in VS Code.
Run Server: Start your Node.js server (node your-file.js).
Create Test File: Make a new file, request.http or request.rest.
Usage
Write Request: In request.http, type GET http://localhost:8000/.
Send Request: Click "Send Request" above the URL in your request.http file.
View Response: A new panel opens with the server's response (Heyy!! I have created my first server.).

Pros
Integrated: Test APIs directly within VS Code, avoiding context switching.	
Version Controlled: .http files are plain text, easily shared via Git.	
Lightweight: Fast for simple, on-the-fly testing.	
Dynamic Variables: Can extract data from one response for the next request.	

Cons
Less Features: Not as robust as Postman for complex needs.
Text-Based: Requires typing requests; no graphical UI for building them.
Learning Curve: Advanced features like variables need specific syntax.
VS Code Dependent: Only works within the VS Code environment.
